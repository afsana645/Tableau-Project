Now I am explaining the visualization here:-

Monthly Sales-
This section displays line charts showing the monthly sales trends for each product category: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology

Sales by Category-
This section presents a horizontal bar chart showing the total sales for each category and sub-category.

Insights:

The categories are listed vertically on the left (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).

The sub-categories are listed next to their respective categories (e.g., Bookcases, Chairs under Furniture).

The length of each bar represents the total sales for that sub-category.

This chart allows for quick identification of the best-selling categories and sub-categories.

From the length of the bars we can see that chairs, phones, and storage are the highest selling sub categories

Profit Map-
This section displays a world map with markers indicating the location of sales transactions. The color or size of the markers likely represents the profit generated at each location.

Insights:

The map provides a visual representation of the geographical distribution of profit.

The concentration and intensity of markers indicate areas with higher sales and profits

This map allows the business to identify key markets and areas for potential growth or improvement.

The map shows large clusters of sales in the United States and Europe

Conclusion:
My experience with Tableau has been enlightening and fulfilling. My understanding of data-driven storytelling has grown as a result of this project, which has also improved my technical proficiency
Itâ€™s a revolutionary tool that will assist anyone make tactical, well-informed decisions and unleash the full power of the data.
